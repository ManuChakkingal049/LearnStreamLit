# Minimum Provision Calculation based on CRMS (CBUAE Guidelines)

This app calculates the minimum provision required for Stage 3 (Wholesale Obligors) under the CRMS guidelines published by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). The calculation follows the steps outlined in **Article 9.23 - Minimum provision for Stage 3 (Wholesale Obligors)**.

### Required Columns:
To perform the calculation, the following columns are required in your input data (CSV file):

1. **Classification Date**: 
   - This represents the classification date of the loan and serves as the **default classification date**.
   - It is used to determine the age of the loan (how long it has been classified) and helps in calculating the minimum provision.
   
2. **TOTAL OS** (Total Outstanding):
   - This represents the total outstanding loan amount.
   
3. **Collateral after H.C.** (Collateral after Haircut):
   - This represents the value of the collateral after applying a haircut, which reduces its value to account for risks like market fluctuations.
   
4. **Unsecured Portion Covered by ECF/DCF**:
   - This represents the portion of the unsecured loan that is covered by **Expected Cash Flows (ECF)** or **Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)**.
   
   
5. **Existing ECL held Q3'24**:
   - This represents the **Existing ECL held in Q3 2024**. 
   - It is used as input to ensure that no **ECL release** occurs solely due to the implementation of the new CRMS guidelines.
   - If the **outstanding loan (OS)** decreases or the **collateral value increases**, it might lead to a reduction in ECL. The **ECL from Q3 2024** acts as a safeguard to avoid any unintended ECL release.

### Input Data Format:
Below is the sample format for the input data that you should upload:

### Key Steps:

1. **Unsecured Portion Calculation**: 
   - The **Unsecured Portion (as whole)** is calculated by subtracting the **Collateral after H.C.** (haircut) from the **TOTAL OS** (total outstanding loan). 
   - If this value is negative, itâ€™s set to zero.

2. **Unsecured Portion Covered by ECF/DCF**:
   - This portion is subtracted from the unsecured portion to calculate the **NET Unsecured Portion (NUSP)**.
   - If part of the unsecured portion is covered by expected cash flows (ECF/DCF), that part does not require provision.

3. **Provision Calculation for Unsecured Portion**:
   - **Approach 1**: 
     - For loans that are **less than 4 years old**, a **25% provision** is applied to the **Unsecured Portion**.
     - For loans that are **older than 4 years**, a **100% provision** is applied to the **Unsecured Portion**.
     
   - **Approach 2**:
     - **No provision** is required for the portion of the unsecured loan that is **covered by expected cash flows (ECF/DCF)**.
     - **100% provision** is applied to the portion that is **not covered by expected cash flows**.

   - The final provision for the **Unsecured Portion** is the **maximum** of the provisions calculated from **Approach 1** and **Approach 2**.

4. **NET SECURED Portion Calculation**:
   - The **NET SECURED Portion** is the minimum value between the **Collateral after H.C.** and the **TOTAL OS** (outstanding loan).
   
5. **Provision for SECURED Portion**:
   - If the loan is **less than 4 years old**, **no provision** is required for the secured portion.
   - If the loan is **older than 4 years**, a **25% provision** is applied to the **NET SECURED Portion**.
   
6. **Final Required Provision/ECL**:
   - The **final provision required** is the sum of the **Provision for Unsecured Portion** and the **Provision for SECURED Portion**.

7. **Final ECL Calculation**:
   - The **Final Calculated ECL with Q3 2024 floor** compares the calculated provision with the **Existing ECL held Q3 2024** and ensures that the result is no less than the existing ECL.
   
8. **Final ECL with OS considered**:
   - If the **ratio of Existing ECL to Total OS** exceeds 1, the **Final ECL with OS considered** is calculated as the maximum between the calculated provision and the total outstanding loan.
   - Otherwise, it takes the maximum between the calculated provision and the existing ECL.

### How This App Works:
This app performs the above steps to calculate the **minimum provision required** for each loan in the uploaded dataset and provides the results, along with an option to download the updated data.

The app applies the CRMS guidelines for provision calculation and takes into account both the **age of the loan** (for unsecured and secured portions) and whether part of the unsecured portion is **covered by expected cash flows (ECF/DCF)**.

You can upload your dataset (CSV file format), enter the **CRMS Issue Date** and **Run Date**, and click "Calculate Provisions" to get the results.
